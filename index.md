# Welcome! This is Jiayi Zhang.

I’m a Ph.D. student in **Operations & Manufacturing Management** at the Olin Business School, Washington University in St. Louis (WashU).  
My research interests include **retailing experiments**, **discrete choice**, and **machine learning for causal inference** (e.g., product-based randomization, SP-MNL, double machine learning).
